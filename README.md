# Planimals


A hackathon project with a unique take on the to-do list concept featuring a virtual pet dependency system. Utilizing AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Node.js for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, we created an engaging web application.


## Reflection

Planimals, emerged from a hackathon setting where our team aimed to craft a full-stack web application with a twist on conventional to-do lists. We sought to integrate a playful element by associating tasks with the care of a virtual "pet," adding an incentive for task completion.

The endeavor was particularly challenging yet enriching as it marked my first experience in a hackathon where I was able to contribute and play a part in this project. This was my first front end experience. One unexpected hurdle I encountered was the significant time investment required to familiarize myself with the new technologies and languages essential for web development. 

Despite the initial learning curve, our team effectively leveraged AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Node.js for the backend, complemented by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. These choices were deliberate, as they offered flexibility, scalability, and customization options essential for our project's unique requirements, showcasing our ability to make informed and strategic technology decisions.

Ultimately, the hackathon concluded with a tangible product that not only met our initial vision but also enriched our collective understanding of web development. Personally, I gained valuable insights into teamwork and production. 

Special thanks to 
Brandon Marks (BrandonMarks6) and Connor Ambrose (CBAmbrose) for their roles working on the backend. 
As well as David Alexander (dlalexa) for being my other half when it came to frontend.
